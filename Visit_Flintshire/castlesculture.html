        <h1>Castles and Culture</h1>
               <p>Flint Castle was the first of many to be built by KIng Edward I in a chain of castles which were erected to encircle North Wales. Ruined sine the end of the English Civil War in 1647, it remains a majestic and dramatic sight perched as it is on the edge of the Dee Estuary. </p>
               <p>St Winefride's Well is one of the oldest Natural Assest in Flintshire. Legend has it that a spring erupted on the shpot where an unwanted suitor, Caradog, cut off Winefride's head when she spurned his advance. It has continued to be a place of pilgrimage and healing since the 7th century.</p>
               <p>Clwyd Theatr Cymru, in Mold, is the leading production theatre in Wales with an international reputation for it's artistic achievements.</p>
